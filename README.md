# DiseasePredictorProject
Overview
Disease Predictor is a lightweight ML project for exploring and preparing a heart-diseaseâ€“style dataset, featuring schema previews, sample rows, and a clear missing-value summary to guide preprocessing and modeling.
It handles mixed categorical and numeric variables such as age, sex, cp, trestbps, chol, restecg, thalch, exang, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal, and predicts the target num.
Fields like slope, ca, and thal exhibit substantial gaps, informing imputation and encoding choices before training classifiers.

Technologies used
Python 3.x for end-to-end data handling and ML workflow.

pandas for tabular data loading, cleaning, and exploration.

NumPy for numerical operations and array manipulation.

scikit-learn for preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling baselines.
