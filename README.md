🩺 Disease Detector

📌 Overview

Disease Predictor is a lightweight ML project for exploring and preparing a heart-disease–style dataset, featuring schema previews, sample rows, and a clear missing-value summary  to guide preprocessing and modeling.
It handles mixed categorical and numeric variables such as age, sex, cp, trestbps, chol, restecg, thalch, exang, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal, and predicts the target num.
Fields like slope, ca, and thal exhibit substantial gaps, informing imputation and encoding choices before training classifiers.
